    <h3>Mediterranean (1920-1940)</h3>
    <p>The Mediterranean style is often referred to as Mediterranean Revival style. Buildings in this style are a mixture of Spanish Colonial Revival, Mission Revival and the Italian Villa style. Mediterranean style buildings are usually one or two story high, with a low pitched terracotta or red tiled roof, stuccoed walls, and rounded or arched windows. The style was popular in California and Florida, with their Mediterranean type weather and resort image.</p>
