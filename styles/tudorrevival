    <h3>Tudor Revival (1890-1940)</h3>
    <p>As with Queen Anne, the style of Tudor Revival buildings diverts from the style of buildings that prevailed in Tudor England (early 16th Century). Instead, the style is loosely based on late Medieval English precedents. Most American Tudor buildings were patterned after late Medieval buildings with Renaissance detailing.</p>
    <p>Some common identifying features of American Tudor Revival include: false thatched roofs, which uses exaggerated rounded edges reminiscent of the roofs of English cottages that were made of straw; prominent steeply-sloped gables dominating the main fa√ßade; half-timber detailing, which are timber patterns with stucco infill; a cross gable or side gable roof; tall, narrow windows usually in multiple groups with multi-pane glazing; massive chimneys crowned with decorative chimney pots; and a complex roof line with intersecting or overlapping gables. Common wall claddings used in Tudor Revival buildings are stucco, brick, wood, and stone. It is common for Tudor Revival houses to use multiple types of wall claddings on the same house. Common window types of Tudor Revival houses include double-hung, casement with decorative glazing, dormer, oriel, and bay windows. The Tudor Revival style was common in America from 1890 to 1940 and is probably one of the most common revival styles used in Urbana.</p>
