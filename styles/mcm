    <h3>Mid-Century Modern (1933-1965)</h3>
    <p>The Mid-century Modern movement also included interior product or furniture design. Often the design of a specific house included custom interior furnishings. The Eames chair designed by Charles Eames and the Tulip chair designed by Eero Saarinen are two iconic products of the mid-century modern movement
Mies van der Roheâ€™s Farnsworth House in Plano, Illinois is an outstanding example of mid-century modern architecture where the architect designed every aspect of the house, from furniture on the interior to the exterior materials and the structure. Important architects of this style include Mies van der Rohe, Eero Saarinen, Alvar Aalto, Oscar Niemeyer, Bertrand Goldberg, Louis Kahn, and Marcel Breuer.</p>
