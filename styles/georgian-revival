    <h3>Georgian Revival (1890-1955)</h3>
    <p>The Colonial Revival style refers to the rebirth of interest in the early English and Dutch colonial houses in the United States. Of the colonial styles, the Georgian and Adam styles are the most widely imitated and form the backbone of the Revival with secondary influences from Postmedieval English and Dutch traditions.
Several characteristics of the original Georgian style were imitated in during the Revival period. The floor plan was commonly rectangular with symmetrical wings. Facades were typically five ranked, symmetrical, and in keeping with Early Georgian style, relatively plain with geometric proportions. In rare examples, facades were designed to be more ornamental, matching the buildings from the late Georgian period. The roof was typically a hipped, gable or gambrel roof, with slate shingles. Revival examples often have paired triple or bay windows, a feature absent in original Georgian buildings. Georgian Revival buildings frequently have one story side wings, either enclosed or open, usually with a flat roof and windows with broken segmental, triangular or ogee pediments. Brick and in particular, the Flemish bond was a popular masonry style.</p>
