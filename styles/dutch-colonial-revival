    <h3>Dutch Colonial Revival</h3>
    <p>The Colonial Revival style refers to the rebirth of interest in the early English and Dutch colonial houses in the United States. Of the colonial styles, the Georgian and Adam styles are the most widely imitated and form the backbone of the Revival with secondary influences from Postmedieval English and Dutch traditions. The Queen Anne and the Shingle styles were also influenced by the Revival. In Colonial Revival architecture details from the precedent styles are freely combined and details may often be exaggerated.
Dutch Colonial Revival style buildings were loosely based on the Dutch Colonial prototypes, with gambrel roofs, flared eaves and multi-paned double hung windows. Dutch Revival houses retain many of the characteristics of the original prototypes, but also differ substantially through the modern introductions of dormers in the gambrel roof, wood shutters and decorative designs cut through the shutters, cross gambrels and occasionally a front facing gambrel end. Constructing a gambrel roof is more complicated than a pitched roof. However, gambrels provide greater headroom under the roof than does a pitched roof covering the same floor area, explaining its popularity in barn construction. The gambrel is in fact an adaptation of a Flemish-French tradition of protecting plastered walls under steeply sloping, thatched roofs by adding a gently sloping extension of tiles at the eaves.
