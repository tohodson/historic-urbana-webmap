Sutton. As any Queen Anne style house, the Sutton house is a very uniquely intricate house. The house is very unique to the area because it is only one of two Queen Anne houses constructed of red brick. The house embodies many of the common Queen Anne characteristics, including an irregular plan, an asymmetrical fa\u00e7ade, a variety of roof and window elements, and a large wrap-around porch. Delicate turned spindles and ornate brackets support an intricate frieze on the wrap-around porch. The roof line of the house is a complex and is a combination of intersecting volumes, shapes, and forms. A square tower with a hipped roof is the tallest element of the house. Ornate brackets support the eaves of the square tower. A \u201ccat-slide\u201d roof element, which extends from the apex of the gable roof to near the ground, is prominent on the house. A white decorative wooden band under the cornice divides the roof level from the lower levels of the house. A common characteristic of Queen Anne houses is to provide a varied wall surface that is broken up by protruding bays and differing wall materials. The Sutton house has one two-story square protruding bay on the corner of the house. The triangular portion of the gable roof, near the apex, is covered with a combination of fish scale and diagonal patterned wood shingle work which is painted white. There is also a limestone water table, or horizontal ledge, near the base of the house. These complex wall planes and surfaces make up the overall intricate form of the house. There are a variety of window types on the Sutton House. The majority of the windows are segmental-arched, double-hung windows with arched brick lintels and limestone window sills. There are several square double-hung windows with stained glass inset. There are a few casement windows which also have stained glass inset into the upper sash. Several dormer windows protrude out from the roof line. Although the architect of the house is unknown, the eccentric and intricate design suggests the work of an accomplished architect.

Main, known is the Griggs House, is a simple Italianate style house that was built in 1874. The house is two stories and is constructed of brick. The overall form of the house consists of a square base topped with a low-pitched gable roof with an ornate cornice. Intricate wood brackets supported the wide overhanging eaves of the ornate cream colored cornice. The front fa\u00e7ade of the house is symmetrical and has a full-width single-story front porch with square wood decorative columns with beveled corners topped with a delicate carved wooden capital and an ornate wood balustrade. An upside down fleur de lie is carved into the cornice of the porch. The windows are tall, narrow, segmental-arched double-hung windows that are divided into four panes. The window sashes consist of two panes each. The windows are \"hooded\" with a brick segmental arch crown. One of the windows on the main first story of the main fa\u00e7ade is replaced with the entry door, which is also topped with a segmental arched hood. Some other small details of the house include a small round window on the west fa\u00e7ade, the gable roof line at the rear of the house is lowered to accommodate only one story, and all of the intricate wood detailing is painted a cream color. The Griggs house is a simple, yet elegant, example of an Italianate style house.", "link": "http://urbanaillinois.us/residents/historic-urbana/100-most-significant-buildings/buildings/505-w-main", "hist_desc": "Clark R. Griggs was born in North Adams, MA in 1824 and came to Champaign County in 1859. He settled on a farm in Philo, which developed into one of the most productive farms in the state.

As a legislator, he was instrumental in persuading the legislature to locate the University of Illinois in Urbana.\u00a0 After the end of his term, he actively dedicated himself to the construction of the Indianapolis, Bloomington and Western Railroad, which was key in the develoment of the region. 505 W.
