<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">210 W. Florida is a Cape Cod style house that was built around 1936. The house is a typical, slightly more ornamented Cape Cod house. It is one and a half stories and has a symmetrical composition with a rectangular footprint. The main entrance is in the center of the main facade below a steeply pitched roof with end gables. The main entrance is surrounded by an elaborate classical entablature with Doric pilasters. The house is clad with limestone. The windows on 210 W. Florida are multi-paned double hung windows with paired shutters. There is a stone chimney that protrudes from the center of the roof. Two hip roofed dormer windows also protrude from the roof. A one car garage sits adjacent to the house.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" style="width:245px;" valign="top"><img alt="" height="159" src="http://urbanaillinois.us/sites/default/files/imagecache/medium/images/florida-w-210-4.jpg" width="240"/></td>

<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Historical Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">One former resident, Robert Floyd, owner of Floyd Electric Motor Service spent several summers in the 1950's prospecting for Uranium in the American west. In various articles in the Urbana-Champaign Courier his efforts were described as akin to fishing trips, except for uranium. His trips were made using a jeep and some basic geological information obtained from the University. While his efforts ultimately proved to be unproductive he stated that he "would like to go prospecting 52 weeks a year."</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr></tbody></table>
