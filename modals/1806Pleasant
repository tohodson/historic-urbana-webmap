<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Designed by Donald R. Laz and built for Federal Appellate Court Judge Fred Green and his wife Carolyn in 1958 by Commercial Builders of Urbana, IL, 1806 S. Pleasant is a Mid Century Modern home with strong Prairie style influences. The Laz house is one story and takes the form of a simple ranch house. However, the details are meticulously designed and executed.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">The roof line is simple and continuous; it is a low-pitched gable roof with wide, overhanging eaves. Large slits, or skylights, can be found carved into the overhanging eaves which create a space below the roof that is open to the elements. A cutout above the courtyard provides sunlight and rain to a small garden space. The entire roof structure is supported by massive exposed fir beams. There are no interior load-bearing walls. Tall trapezoidal windows make a strong Mid Century statement. The house design evokes the Mid Century Modern and Prairie Style themes of connecting the nature outside with the interior spaces. The current owners added a two-story workshop to the property, which houses a furniture studio on the lower level and a design and glass studio on the second floor. The workshop was designed in a modernist style. Materials, colors and windows were selected to refer to and extend the design of the main house.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" style="width:245px;" valign="top"><a href="http://urbanaillinois.us/residents/historic-urbana/top100/1806PleasantSketch"><img alt="" height="179" src="http://urbanaillinois.us/sites/default/files/imagecache/medium/images/1806pleasant-drawing.jpg" width="240"/></a></td>
