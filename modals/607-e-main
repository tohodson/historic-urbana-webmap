<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">607 E. Main, known as the Weber House, is a simple Italianate house that was built around 1875. The house is constructed of brick which is painted pale yellow. The house has an L-shaped plan with a steeply sloped cross-gable roof. The house has a simple cornice with widely overhanging eaves. The windows of the house are double-hung windows, two panes over two panes, with a segmental arch top accented with red segmental arch lintels and flat sills. The main entrance to the house is covered by a small one-story porch which is supported by simple, round, white, classical columns. The main entry door has a classical surround consisting of a rounded arch top and fluted pilasters flanking either side. The roof near the main entrance has a flared eave. The house also has a small rear porch which is supported by a single round classical column in the corner. The small classical details of 607 E. Main add to the character of the Italianate house.</td></tr></tbody></table>
