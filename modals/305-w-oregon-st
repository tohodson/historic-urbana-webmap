<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">305 W. Oregon is a typical Prairie Style house built in 1917. The house is constructed of proportionately large gray concrete blocks which emphasize the horizontal plane of the house, characteristic of the Prairie Style. The top half of the second story is clad with rough textured stucco. A protruding horizontal band of stone separates the concrete block and the stucco textures. The low-pitched hipped roof with wide, overhanging eaves has a wood band underneath which emphasizes the horizontal plane. The main façade of the house is symmetrical with horizontal rows of three windows flanked by tall concrete block piers which seem to grow out of the smooth facade. The majority of the windows on the house are wide, squat, double-hung windows with 6 panes over one pane and are outlined with brown trim. A car port supported by two massive concrete block piers is found on the east side of the house. The symmetry of the car port is mirrored on the other side of the house by an enclosed porch. The main entrance is below the car port overhang and is perpendicular to the street. The main entrance stairs are flanked by two knee-high squat piers and one carved stone animal.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" style="width:245px;" valign="top">
