<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">706 S. Mathews is a Tudor Revival Greek House constructed in 1924 and is home to the Alpha Omicron Pi Sorority. The house is constructed mostly of brown brick and much of the upper stories of the house are covered with half timber detailing with stucco infill. The large three story house has a hipped roof. Many of the windows are multi-paned casement windows with wood trim and brick sills. Several windows protrude through the cornice line of the roof. The main entrance to the house is below a recessed porch with an arcade made up of flattened pointed Gothic arches, known as Tudor arches.</td></tr></tbody></table>
