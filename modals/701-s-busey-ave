<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">This charming little cottage was designed by Joseph Royer for his mother-in-law Ella Danley in 1923. 701 S. Busey is an English Domestic style cottage which embodies the architectural style of English country houses. The house is very small and has smooth stone walls with a rough cut stone foundation. The cottage also has some rough cut stone accent pieces on the prominent chimney in the front of the house and the arched entry. The main doorway has rounded corners and is covered by an eyebrow arch in the roof. The windows are small, double-hung, four-paned window sashes and are outlined with red wood trim. There are dormer windows on the north side of the house. The roof is very steep and is made of shingles. The roof form is a hip roof with flared eaves. Some parts of the roof are a faux thatched roof, which has exaggerated rounded edges evoking the real thatched roofs of traditional English cottages. The northeast corner wall of the cottage is chamfered. The house has a large front yard surround by a wooden fence.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" style="width:245px;" valign="top">

<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Historical Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">The mother-in-law cottage, also known as the Danely Cottage, inspired Ella Danley to write The Fairy Book, a collection of children's stories. By the middle of the 20th century, it was tradition for Leal School kindergarten students to visit the house. Over the course of the year, The Fairy Book would be read to students and afterward they would be taken to the house to see the setting for the stories.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr></tbody></table>
