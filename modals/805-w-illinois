<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">805 W. Illinois is a characteristic Queen Anne style house built in 1890. The house falls under the Free Classic Queen Anne style subtype because of its subtle classical detailing. The main feature of the house is the shingle-covered steeply-pitched gable roofs with flared eaves. The gables of the main façade are overlapping, and run perpendicularly to the gables on the east and west facades. The overall composition of the house is asymmetrical. The house is covered with white horizontal wood clapboard siding. The house has a one-story full-width porch with classical columns that support the hipped porch roof. A gable pediment accents the main entrance. The pediment is also covered in shingles and has a small niche cut into the tympanum. The columns have square, fluted posts and an abstract classical capital. Differing wall planes is a common characteristic of Queen Anne style houses, an example of which is the two-story cantilevered bay wall extension on the east side of 805 W. Illinois. The cantilever is supported by brackets. The house has a variety of window types, including dormer windows on the west facade, elongated diamond casement windows near the entrance, recessed casement windows in the triangular portion of the gables on the front façade, simple double-hung windows, and large casement windows with diamond plate glass. The subtle white washed details of 805 W. Illinois are very elegant and typical of Queen Anne houses.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr></tbody></table>
