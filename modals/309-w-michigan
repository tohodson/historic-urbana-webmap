<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">309 W. Michigan was built in 1925 for Dr. H.A. Hindman who was a prominent local dentist. The house is an interesting combination of a Mediterranean and Italian Renaissance styles. Overall, the house has a symmetrical five part façade. The central two-story entrance portal projects out farther than the rest of the house and is flanked by two recessed wings of the same height. There are then two one-story wings flanking the east and west sides of the house, which make up the five part facade. The one-story wings have solid decorative balustrades on their roofs. The roof of 309 W. Michigan is a low-sloped hipped roof with green clay tiles and widely overhanging eaves. The house is constructed of buff colored brick. The house has a small recessed arched entry porch flanked by two classical columns of the Doric order. The entry door is flanked by side lights. The shape of the porch mimics the shape of a Palladian window, with a taller arched portion in the center and two smaller rectangular portions on either side. The upper story windows of the house are less elaborate than the lower story windows. The first story windows are arched and have shutters, which mimic the form of a Palladian window. The second story windows are pairs of multi-paned double-hung windows with blue paired shutters. The tile hip roof is characteristic of Mediterranean architecture and the five part façade, window styles, and classical details are characteristic of Italian Renaissance architecture. The interesting blend of architectural styles makes 309 W. Michigan a very unique house in the neighborhood.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr></tbody></table>
