The rear of 601 W. High has a complex roof line with stacking dormer windows and a slight gambrel roof. The dormers are covered with rectangular wood shingles. Small two-over-two light windows are present in the dormers. Below the stacking dormer windows is a recessed side porch which is supported by simple square classical columns of the Doric order. The porch has a simple square balustrade. The house has a tall brick chimney. The cornice of the house is accented by white wood trim. 601 W.
