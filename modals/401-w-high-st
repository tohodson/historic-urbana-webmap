<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">401 W. High is a small, simple Hall and Parlor house built in 1880. The hall and parlor house, with two wings, a hall, and a parlor, was a very common early floor plan for colonial American houses. Originally, the main entrance opened into a vestibule which led into each room. A stairway to the loft is also located in the vestibule. The hall served as the common family space of the house and the parlor served as the sleeping area. A loft space usually overlooked the hall and parlor space. It was common for hall and parlor plan houses to add a lean-to for extra space. 401 W. High has horizontal wood shingle siding painted white. The house has a stone foundation and a steeply-pitched gable roof. The windows are double-hung windows with four-light panes on the top and bottom. The main entrance consists of a 6-paneled door painted red. The entrance is covered by a gable roof overhang supported by brackets. A number of additions, including a screened-in porch have been built.</td></tr></tbody></table>
