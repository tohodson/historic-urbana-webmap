<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">1802 S. Pleasant is a contemporary house designed by Jack Baker and John Replinger in 1957. While shaped like a typical mid-century ranch house, Baker used classic Prairie-style elements, including the wide, overhanging roof eaves, horizontal bands of casement windows divided by thick wooden mullions, and a picturesque entrance sequence with rounded stairs leading up to the entry, to create a contemporary and lively design. The low-pitched gable roof along with the long, thin, rectangular form and brown vertical wood siding emphasizes the horizontal plane. The main floor overhangs the stone foundation. An overhanging car port extends perpendicularly off the house, giving the house an L-shaped plan. Finally, a tall chimney protrudes from the roof.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" style="width:245px;" valign="top">
