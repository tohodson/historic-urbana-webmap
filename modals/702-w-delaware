<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">702 W. Delaware is a Tudor Revival house built in 1932. The house has typical Tudor Revival details including an asymmetrical composition, a steeply pitched cross gable roof, multi-paned casement windows, and half timber decoration. The main façade of the house is dominated by a steeply pitched gable with flared eaves. The wall surface of this gable is brick and the entry is recessed below a brick archway with a limestone keystone. A smaller gable breaks through the cornice of the main façade. The wall surface of this gable has half timber decoration with stucco infill. The second story wall surface projects farther outward than the first story wall surface; this is a common characteristic of Tudor Revival architecture. Many of the windows of 702 W. Delaware are multi-paned casement windows divided by wood muntins. Several of the windows have paired wooden shutters and the window on the main brick gable has a wooden flower box below. As is typical for homes in this part of Urbana, four of the five families associated with the home have been affiliated with the University of Illinois.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr></tbody></table>
