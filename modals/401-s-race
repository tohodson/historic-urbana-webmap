Race is a typical Italianate style house that was built in 1870 for Yohlon Salome Lindley. The house is two stories and is constructed of brick which is painted white. A one-story porch wraps around two sides of the house. The house has a low-pitched hip roof with wide overhanging eaves and a simple classical cornice with a simple classical entablature. The porch roof is supported by thick, square, brick columns which support a simple cornice with a simple classical entablature band and wide overhanging eaves. The majority of the house has tall, thin, double-hung windows with two panes over two panes, which is common of the Italianate style. The windows are hooded with a segmental arch lintel. The hoods are painted blue and the trim of the windows is painted red. A two-story bay window covered with wood siding protrudes from the side of the house. The Lindley house is very characteristic of the Italianate architectural style.</td></tr></tbody></table>
