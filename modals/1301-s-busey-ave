<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">1301 S. Busey is a simple Colonial Revival house that was built in 1922. The house has white horizontal wood clapboard siding and has a symmetrical facade. The main entrance to the house is in the center of the building and is covered by a one story porch. The porch is supported by large Doric columns. The entry door has a fan light above it and side lights flanking it. The door and the side lights are divided by classical pilasters. The windows on the first and second stories are six over six pane double hung windows with paired shutters. There are three large dormer windows protruding from the steeply pitched gable roof. The dormer windows have a triangular pediment and simple pilasters surrounding a double-hung window. The short façade of the house has a Palladian window motif below the broken cornice line. 1301 S. Busey is a simply beautiful example of a Colonial Revival house.</td></tr></tbody></table>
