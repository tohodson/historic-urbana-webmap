<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">1004 S. Lincoln is one of the University of Illinois’ many Greek houses. This house is currently the Phi Beta Chi Sorority and it was constructed in 1928 in the Mediterranean architectural style. The two story house is constructed of a multi-toned buff colored brick. The house has a low-pitched green clay tile hip roof with exposed brackets under the cornice. There are two large chimneys protruding from the roof which are topped with decorative chimney pots. The main entrance to 1004 S. Lincoln is recessed below a one-story porch with an archway. A decorative stone keystone marks the apex of the arch. The one story entrance porch is topped with a decorative balustrade. Many of the windows on the house are tall, thin, multi-paned casement windows which are grouped in horizontal rows. There are two rounded arch windows on the main façade.  A stone roundel decorates the wall surface between the two arched windows. All of the windows have stone window sills, red wood trim, and brick lintels. A brick string course accentuates the top half of the second story of the house.</td></tr></tbody></table>
