<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">507 W. Main was built in 1880 for the Luther family in the Gothic Revival style. The house is a simply decorated symmetrical house which has a common Gothic Revival floor plan known as the T-plan. A T-plan house has a central wing which houses the main entrance and a side wing which is perpendicular to the central wing, creating a T-shape. The central wing is projected forward slightly from the perpendicular wing, similar to a cruciform plan. The house has simple light gray horizontal siding. The windows are tall, thin, double-hung windows surrounded by white trim. Both wings of the house are two stories and are topped with a gable roof. Decorative verge board, or decorative trim, can be found under the eaves of the main gable. The east and west sides of the Luther Residence have a one-story protruding wing with slanted roofs. A one story porch is found on the main entrance. The front door of 507 W. Main has a transom light which is divided into two panes above the door. The entry porch has square classical porch supports supporting decorative brackets. Overall, this Gothic Revival house is very elegant for its simplicity.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr></tbody></table>
