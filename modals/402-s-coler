<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">402 S. Coler is a small Cape Cod style house that was built in 1940. The house is one and a half stories and has a steeply pitched roof with end gables. The house has a rectangular footprint and is clad with horizontal wood clapboard siding. There is a large chimney protruding from the center of the roof. The house has very little ornamentation and is symmetrical in composition. The main entrance is in the center of the house with two windows on either side and a classical entablature surrounds the doorway. The windows are double hung multi-paned casement windows with paired wooden shutters. There are also two dormer windows protruding from the roof which have multi-paned double hung windows. Two shed dormer windows sit on the rear roof of the house. A small bay window protrudes from the short end of the house. On the opposite side of the house there is a small porch which is supported by classical columns.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr></tbody></table>
