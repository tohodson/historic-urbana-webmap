<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">900 S. Race is a small Tudor Revival building that was built in 1926. The one story building is constructed of brick. The building has a steeply-pitched gable roof with flared eaves. The plan is L-shaped and in the crook of the L there is a hipped roof. The most distinguishing characteristic of Tudor Revival buildings is half timber detailing. The brown half timber detailing and cream colored stucco infill on 900 S. Race is located in the triangular portion of the gable roofs. The west entrance of the building has a large Tudor arch window. Small dormer windows, also with gable roofs and flared eaves, are lined along the roof. Small plain wooden shields act as decoration on the dormer windows. Many of the other windows on 900 S. Race are multi-paned casement windows with wood trim. The north façade has an enormous multi-paned casement window near the entrance. The entrance is recessed below the roof and has decorative brackets supporting the roof. All of these details are characteristic of the Tudor Revival architectural style.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" style="width:245px;" valign="top"><img alt="" height="159" src="http://urbanaillinois.us/sites/default/files/imagecache/medium/images/race-s-900-8.jpg" width="240"/></td>
