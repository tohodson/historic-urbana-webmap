<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">301 W. Indiana, known as the Stevens House, was built in 1925 in Tudor Revival Style. The main feature of the house is the half-timber decoration with cream colored stucco infill. The roof form is characteristic of Tudor Revival houses where a steeply-pitched gable roof dominates the front façade. However, the rest of the roof consists of a false thatched roof and exaggerated rounded corners, with flared eaves. This roof style mimics the picturesque thatched roofs found on rural English houses and is relatively rare for an American Tudor Revival home. The roof is also unusual for the way that it incorporates all three common roof types usually found on Tudor style buildings including a main cross gable, a flared hip roof, and a false thatched roof. The steeply pitched gable wall surface overhangs the wall surface of the first level below where the floor beams are exposed. Below the exposed floor beams sits a bay window made up of four tall, thin, eight-paned windows. A large chimney, clad in stone at the base, stucco in the center, and brick at the top, dominates the center of the main facade. The main entry is recessed below a rounded arch accented by rough-cut stone, also referred to as quoins. The entry door has a segmental arched top. The asymmetrical composition of this house is typical of a Tudor Revival style house.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" style="width:245px;" valign="top"><a href="http://urbanaillinois.us/node/2699"><img alt="" height="159" src="http://urbanaillinois.us/sites/default/files/imagecache/medium/images/indiana-w-301-5.jpg" width="240"/></a></td>

<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Historical Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">The design for 301 W. Indiana was evidently ordered from Architect’s Small House Service Bureau. While not confirmed, the resemblance to known plans as illustrated in the photos below is striking. In contrast to the prefab Sears homes, plan book homes were built using locally available supplies. While Sears homes were often found in close proximity to rail lines, plan book homes tend to be more dispersed.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Long-time resident, Richard D. Millican lived in the house from 1954 until approximately 2001.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr></tbody></table>
