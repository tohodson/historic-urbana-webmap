    <h3>Architectural Description</h3>
    <p>Probably the most fascinating architectural creation on this list, Bruce Goff&#39;s contemporary design for 2016 S. Burlison resembles something fallen from outer space. Built in 1954, the house is referred to as the Round House, or the Garvey House, as it was commissioned by University of Illinois piano professor John Garvey. Garvey commissioned Goff to design “a house that was more than a house.” Unfortunately, Goff’s highly ambitious first design had to be abandoned when Kaiser Aluminum withdrew their pledge to donate supplies.</p>


    <h3>Historical Description</h3>
    <p>John Garvey met Bruce Goff while giving a performance at the University of Oklahoma where Goff was the chair of the architecture department. The Garvey House was one of Goff’s last designs while on the Oklahoma faculty. In 1955 Goff was forced out amidst a scandal.</p>
