<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">309 W. Green was designed by Joseph Royer and was constructed in 1913 in the Late Gothic Revival style. It is currently home to the Unitarian Universalist Church. The church has a steeply pitched gable roof and is constructed of irregularly coursed roughly cut limestone. The main form of the church consists of a rectangular nave, which is topped with the steeply pitched gable roof, and a square tower.  The square tower is also constructed of roughly cut limestone and has crenellations at the top. Many of the windows are rows of squat pointed arches while other openings are rectangular. The door on the square tower also has a pointed arched doorway. The north façade of the church has a large rose window with decorative plate glass. A Prairie style addition was added to the east side of the church in 1955.</td></tr></tbody></table>
