<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">804 W. Pennsylvania, known as the Ernest T. Robbins residence, is a Tudor Revival style house built in 1925. Unlike many homes in the neighborhood, the home remained in the same family for 44 years. Consequentally it has remained mostly unmodified and is an excellent example of 1920's Tudor Revival. The wall surface is smooth and continuous gray stucco. Main features of the house are wood detailing painted in maroon. The overall form of the house is two massive intersecting steeply pitched gables; each sweepingly dominates the main and side facades. The main entrance is recessed and is emphasized by a small gable overhang. The entry porch has a flattened gothic archway, known as a Tudor arch. The porch overhang is supported by square wooden columns and decorative spindles. The windows are double-hung, the top and bottom sashes each with six panes. The windows are surrounded by decorative wooden paired shutters. A prominent chimney sits in center of the main front gable. The roof line has no projecting eaves; in other words the eaves are flush with the wall surface. A small wooden band painted maroon accentuates the eaves. There is a small interior porch on the east side of the house with bands of horizontal windows. The house has a brick foundation and the bricks are placed vertically instead of, most commonly, horizontal.</td></tr></tbody></table>
