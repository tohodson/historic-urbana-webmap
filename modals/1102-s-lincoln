The house is constructed of rough-faced stone and has an asymmetrical composition. The house has a steeply pitched gable roof with a large chimney topped with decorative chimney pots on one end. The main entrance to the house is below a recessed flattened Gothic, or Tudor, archway. Many of the windows on 1102 S. Lincoln are tall, thin, rectangular multi-paned casement windows which are organized in horizontal rows. Some windows have stained glass present. There is cast stone trim around the windows. A large two story bay window is present on the main façade. The third story of the house has a row of dormer windows. There is decorative stone garland, called strap work, and decorative half-timbering that add to the wall surface ornamentation of the house.</td></tr></tbody></table>
