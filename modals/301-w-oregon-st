<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Historical Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">According to Mathilda Hill, who lived at 303 W. Oregon for her entire life, 301 W. Oregon was built in 1903 as a "honeymoon cottage" for Frank Somers and his wife Aurora. The house currently located at the rear of the lot, facing Cedar St., was owned by Mr. Somers' father and was the original house on the lot. According to local stories, Mr. Somers' moved the home to the rear of the lot because the sounds of horse hooves early in the morning (for ice delivery) disturbed his sleep.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr></tbody></table>
