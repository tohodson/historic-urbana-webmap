<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">202 S. Broadway is a Classical Revival building designed by Oscar Wendroth in 1914. The building is home to the Urbana Post Office which is located in Urbana’s historic downtown. The civic importance of the post office is reflected in its monumental architecture. The building is two stories and is constructed of buff colored brick with a limestone base. The overall composition of the building is symmetrical. The windows on the post office are multi-paned double hung windows with limestone sills. The most distinguishing feature of the building is the main entrance, which is located below a two-story recessed porch which has colossal limestone classical columns of the Corinthian order supporting a classical entablature and cornice. A flat roof with limestone coping rises above the slightly projecting classical cornice. A classical limestone surround accents the main door. A large set of stairs leading up to the main entrance is a grand gesture which asserts the civic importance of the building.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr></tbody></table>
