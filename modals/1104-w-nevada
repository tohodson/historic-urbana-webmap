<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">1104 W. Nevada is a Jacobean Greek House that was built in 1926. The house is home to the Sigma Delta Tau Sorority. The house is constructed of multi-colored brick with interspersed limestone blocks. The composition of the house is asymmetrical and the main façade is dominated by a steeply pitched cross gable roof inset into a hip roof. The cornice of the roof has exposed wood rafters. A two story rounded bay window protrudes from the main façade. A large brick chimney with limestone details protrudes from the roof. Many of the windows are tall, thin, hinged casement windows. Many of the windows are arranged in horizontal rows. Some of the casement windows have diamond patterned panes of glass held together by lead cames, or grooved strips of lead. Each window is divided by limestone mullions. This unique architectural revival style is used on a very small number of Greek Houses on the University of Illinois campus.</td></tr></tbody></table>
