<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Designed by Joseph Royer in 1919, this Dutch Colonial Revival house is two stories with red brick walls and a steeply pitched gable roof. The form of the house, rectangular plan with a gable roof running parallel to the main entrance, reflects the Dutch Colonial Revival style. The main façade is symmetrical, with an elaborate entrance in the center. Georgian detailing is also a common feature of Dutch Colonial buildings. The Georgian entrance has a broken rounded arch pediment supported on either side by groups of three simple round classical columns of the Doric order. The entablature of the porch is also of the Doric order. The front door has multi-paned side lights and small thin pilasters flanking either side. The windows are mostly double-hung windows with a six pane top sash and a single pane bottom sash. The windows have brick lintels with limestone keystones. There are exposed rafters below the roof eaves. There are subtle brick quoin details on the corners of the house. The east side of the house has a one-story room projecting out. The room has a flat roof topped with a stone cap. The space has a decorative stone balustrade inset into the wall and tall, narrow windows. The east end of the house is terminated with a massive brick chimney. This form of Dutch Colonial house usually has paired chimneys on both ends of the house, but in this case the chimney is only on one side.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" style="width:245px;" valign="top"> </td>
