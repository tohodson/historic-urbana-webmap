<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">713 W. Ohio is a Late Gothic Revival Greek House that was constructed in 1930. The house was historically the Delta Tau Delta Fraternity but is currently home to Sigma Pi. The overall composition of the house is asymmetrical and is constructed of irregularly coursed smooth faced stone. The rear of the house has some half timber decoration on the attic story. The house has a steeply pitched gable roof and the largest gable on the main façade has flared eaves. There are two stepped cross gables on the flared gable. The stone wall covering extends up into the gable roofs, a common feature of Gothic Revival architecture. The main entrance to the house is below a two story bay projection which is mirrored on the other half of the façade with a window in place of the door. The door has a label molding above it, a typical Gothic Revival motif. The bay windows are each topped with crenellations. Many of the windows are horizontal rows of multi-paned casement windows or large single pane casement windows with wood trim. There are also several dormer windows protruding from the roof. A large chimney also protrudes from the roof. Overall, 713 W. Ohio is an intricately detailed Late Gothic Revival building.</td></tr></tbody></table>
