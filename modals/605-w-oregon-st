<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">605 W. Oregon is a Dutch Colonial Revival house that was built in 1920. The house is two stories tall, which is actually a very unusual type of Dutch Colonial Revival house, as they are usually one story. The house has a very intricate roof line consisting of a cross gambrel roof with odd dormer windows filling in the gap between the cross gambrels. The cornice lines of the gambrel roof are accented with cream-colored trim. The gambrel roof actually projects farther out than the wall below it. The house is covered in horizontal wood shingles which are painted maroon. A large brick chimney penetrates the gambrel roof on the main façade of the house. The entry porch is recessed and is supported by simple square classical columns of the Tuscan order. The columns sit on concrete piers and support a simple cream-colored entablature. There are a variety of windows on the house, including double-hung windows, casement windows, and bay windows, some of which have diamond-patterned stained glass present. The window frames are also accented with cream-colored classical window surrounds. The splendid composition and intricacies of the house create a beautiful Dutch Colonial Revival building.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" style="width:245px;" valign="top"><img alt="" height="159" src="http://urbanaillinois.us/sites/default/files/imagecache/medium/images/oregon-w-605-9.jpg" width="240"/></td>
