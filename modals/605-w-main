Main is Queen Anne style house which is similar to many of its neighbors on the Main Street. The house was built in 1890 at a grand scale. The house has a typical asymmetrical composition, a complex roof line, and varying wall surface materials. The main feature is the soaring square tower which marks the entrance to the house.

The house also has several steeply sloped gable roofs and a one-story entry porch that wraps around two sides of the house. The porch roof is supported by decorative spindles and solid triangular brackets. A fish scale shaped frieze runs between the brackets and diagonal latticework decorates the base of the porch. A balustrade on the porch is absent. A common feature of Queen Anne style houses is the use of differentiation of wall materials. 605 W.
