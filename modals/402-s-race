<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">402 S. Race is a Tudor Revival building built in 1920. The four story building is currently an apartment building near Lincoln Square. The building is constructed of red brick and is almost symmetrical. Brick clad buildings are the most common Tudor Revival buildings. The most distinguishing feature of 402 S. Race is the steeply-pitched gable roofs. There is one large gable on the east and west facades, and two smaller gables on each of the north and south facades. There are two very small dormer windows also with gable roofs nestled in between the two large gables on the north and south facades. There are also two shed dormer windows on either side of the large gables on the north and south facades. All of the gables have distinguishing half timber detailing. The half timber detailing is painted red with brown stucco infill. Many of the windows on 402 S. Race are multi-paned double-hung and multi-paned casement windows. The corners of the building are projecting square bays. Horizontal limestone string courses divide the façade. The main entrance to the building is a Tudor arch, or a flattened pointed arch, under a limestone entrance portal.</td></tr></tbody></table>
