<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">312 W. Oregon is an Art Deco building that was designed by Joseph Royer and built in 1936. The building is home to Leal Elementary School. The building is constructed of buff colored brick with smooth cut limestone details. The building is two stories tall and is divided into five bays. The central bay is the tallest and most prominent bay. The two bays flanking the central bay are articulated by alternating vertical brick piers and large pane windows. The two end bays do not have any windows and just have a limestone band near the top of the second story.  The roof of the Leal School is flat and has limestone coping. The central bay has a large curtain wall where the main entrance is located. A carved inscription panel above the main entrance reads “Leal School” in an Art Deco-inspired font. Large pane windows sit above the inscription panel. The only ornamentation on the building consists of abstract rectilinear geometry, which can be seen on the piers flanking the main entrance, on the limestone banding above the second story windows, and below the sill of the second story windows. The simple Art Deco architectural abstraction of the Leal School makes the building a unique object in the neighborhood.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr></tbody></table>
