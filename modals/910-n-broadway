<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">910 N. Broadway is a Queen Anne house built in 1901. In contrast to the majority of Queen Anne homes in Urbana, 910 N. Broadway was built with brick. The house is two and a half stories tall with steeply pitched cross gable roofs and a one story wrap-around porch with a two story center portion. The second story portion of the porch is supported by brick piers. The rest of the porch has intricate ironwork supports and balustrades. The base of the porch is detailed with brick. The triangular portions of the gable roofs are covered with wood shingles and are separated by pent roofs. A Palladian window motif can be found in one of the gable triangles. The cornices below the pent roofs are articulated with a differentiating brick pattern. The windows are large single pane casement windows with rectangular transoms above. The windows have segmental arch brick hoods, which is usually an Italianate motif. Several other windows are double-hung windows also with segmental arch brick hoods.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr></tbody></table>
