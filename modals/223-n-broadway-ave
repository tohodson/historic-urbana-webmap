<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">223 N. Broadway is home to the Station Theatre which was built in 1923 and located in Urbana’s historic downtown. The Station Theatre was built as a passenger rail station for the Big Four Railroad and was the third station built for the Urbana rail line. The architectural style of the station can be referred to as Train Station Vernacular, as similar details were used in the design of other train stations during that time period. Several features of the station include an overall one story rectilinear form with steeply pitched cross gable roofs covered with orange clay tiles. The gables have projecting cornices which have a partial classical return. The station is constructed of brick and has a horizontal limestone base, water table, and cornice. The windows on the station are small rectangular windows with stained glass and limestone sills. A semi-circular window with a classical surround sits above the main entrance to the station. The station is no longer used as a train station but instead is currently home to a performing arts group and is known as the Station Theatre.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td></tr></tbody></table>
