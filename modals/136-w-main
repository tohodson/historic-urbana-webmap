<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Historical Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">In the late 1800s, no town could call itself legitimate unless it had two railroads, two banks, a cigar factory, a tailor, dressmaker, and a milliner. Nathan Cohen was the town cigar manufacturer and in 1907, he commissioned the building of 136 W. Main to house his cigar factory. After Cohen retired, the building housed a variety of businesses including the Embassy Tavern and One Thirty Barber Shop. Currently the  houses a law office.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Cohen was born in Philadelphia in 1850. After working in theater and opera, Cohen decided to settle in Urbana and start a tobacco and cigar store. In 1880, he married Addie Bernstein, daughter of prominent Champaign merchant Sol Bernstein. The family settled in Urbana in a home initially located at the corner of West Elm and Orchard and later moved to the 700 block of East Green Street.</td></tr></tbody></table>
