<h3><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Architectural Description</span></h3></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">606 W. Ohio is the Alpha Chi Sigma Greek House that was constructed in 1935 in the Gothic Revival architectural style. The house is three stories and is constructed of irregularly coursed smooth-faced stone. The overall form of the house has steeply pitched cross gable roofs. There are two front-facing gables with flared eaves on the main façade of the house. The cornices of the gables consist of simple wood trim which are flush with the wall surface. The house has an asymmetrical composition. The main entrance to the house is in a one story hexagonal bay. The majority of the windows on 606 W. Ohio are casement windows with diamond-patterned stained glass. The windows are arranged in horizontal rows. The windows are accented with wood trim. There are several singular casement windows and dormer windows protruding from the roof as well. There are several one story bay windows on the main façade as well. Many of the windows have a label molding above them, a characteristic Gothic Revival detail. There are several Tudor archways on the house. Last but not least, there is some half-timber detailing on the house.</td></tr></tbody></table>
